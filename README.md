# Coursera-Practical-Machine-Learning

Steps done in this project:
1. Download and load data sets
2. Explore the number of classifiers in the data set
3. For Pre-processing
    - Drop all columns with greater than 50% N/A
    - Drop Unnecessary Columns not needed for modeling
4. Perfrom Cross-Validation
    - set a 75-25 train-test partition in the training dataset
5. Begin Modeling
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
          - Plot Accuracy
          - Plot Model Error
6. Select a Model for Final Prediction with your Testing Set
